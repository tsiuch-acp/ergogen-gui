## Ergogen GUI 
This is a web interface for [Ergogen](https://github.com/mrzealot/ergogen) by @MrZealot.  

### :warning: This repo currently relies on an outdated Webpack 4, moving to Webpack 5 is non-trivial due to outdated dependencies like openjscad which depend on browserify and node polyfills

This adds some additional features like
- Live preview reloading
- VSCode editor (Monaco)
- Live 3D model previews
- Auto regenerate outlines, 3D models and PCBs
- Bundles custom footprints from [github.com/ceoloide/ergogen-footprints](https://github.com/ceoloide/ergogen-footprints)

See the live demo at [https://ceoloide.github.io/ergogen-gui/](https://ceoloide.github.io/ergogen-gui/) or [https://ergogen.ceoloide.com](https://ergogen.ceoloide.com)
